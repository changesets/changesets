For example:

```js
import { temporarilySilenceLogs } from "@changesets/test-utils";
import { log } from "@changesets/logger";

temporarilySilenceLogs();

// Now the logs in this test file are not actually logged to std out
log("I am not logged");

// Use console.log to log messages in tests if required
console.log("Yay, I am logged");
```
