### Patch Changes

- [#997](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/997) [`4d4d67b`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/4d4d67b74f9de9dfdc78b9d3cf904c6b69b81ce5) Thanks [@JakeGinnivan](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan)! - Add error message when running changesets in a repo with workspaces configured but no packages yet

- [#985](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/985) [`8d0115e`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/8d0115ea8b2b2e0c0072c8f69898e65a5a7aebd3) Thanks [@mino01x](https://github.com/mino01x)! - Fixed an issue with private packages with versions being included in the CLI prompt despite the `privatePackages.version: false` setting.

## 2.25.0

### Minor Changes

- [#662](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/662) [`8c08469`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/8c0846977597ddaf51aaeb35f1f0f9428bf8ba14) Thanks [@JakeGinnivan](https://github.com/JakeGinnivan)! - Private packages can now be tagged in the same way public packages do when they are published to npm.

  To enable set `privatePackages: { version: true, tag: true }` in your config.json.

  You can also now opt private packages out of versioning entirely by setting `privatePackages: false`.

### Patch Changes

- [#953](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/953) [`98d63e0`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/98d63e0a85506175e219b93478a814f8588c52d3) Thanks [@alexamy](https://github.com/alexamy)! - Add a new line at the end of the default config file generated when invoking `changeset init`.

- [#949](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/949) [`64585ea`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/64585ea4323c4cf51a23b0635990b568d1f58b2b) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist), [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Fixed the issue that caused transitive dependents of dev dependents to be bumped when a package got bumped and when using `___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH.updateInternalDependents: "always"`. To illustrate this with an example:

  ```
  pkg-a - version: 1.0.0
  pkg-b - devDependencies['pkg-a']: 1.0.0
  pkg-c - dependencies['pkg-b']: 1.0.0
  ```

  With a changeset for `pkg-a` the `pkg-c` could have been sometimes incorrectly released.

### Patch Changes

- [#858](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/858) [`dd9b76f`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/dd9b76f162a546ae8b412e0cb10277f971f3585e) Thanks [@dotansimha](https://github.com/dotansimha)! - A possibility to use the calculated version for snapshot releases is now stable 🥳 All snapshot-related config parameters are now grouped under a single config property called `snapshot`.

  To migrate, make sure to update your `config.json`.

  Old usage (still works, but comes with a deprecated warning):

  ```json
  {
    "___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH": {
      "useCalculatedVersionForSnapshots": true
    }
  }
  ```

  New usage:

  ```json
  {
    "snapshot": {
      "useCalculatedVersion": true
    }
  }
  ```

## 2.23.1

### Patch Changes

- [#843](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/843) [`101b1cb`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/101b1cb7e45f23146ce764a892a9ba04ed545cc5) Thanks [@caohuilin](https://github.com/caohuilin)! - Fixed the printed filename in the verbose output of `changeset status`.

This ensures that installs of snapshot versions are always reproducible.

- [#744](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/744) [`84e46d1`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/84e46d19bd26c3a4ab6ff6d0543bd327dfa32a10) Thanks [@mskelton](https://github.com/mskelton)! - Ignored packages are no longer listed when adding a changeset.

### Patch Changes

- [#811](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/811) [`c54c25d`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/c54c25d7bbbdc055d2df97396c3b73e66f8b3b78) Thanks [@samrose3](https://github.com/samrose3)! - Improved accessibility of the CLI prompts by using selected/unselected indicators that don't rely solely on the colors.

- [#767](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/767) [`d6bfcc5`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d6bfcc5052dcba18c521a20d62e2e67a81819112) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Improve the error message when a package referenced in a changeset can't be found.

You can now point to a module (using a module name or a relative path) that might contain `getAddMessage` and/or `getVersionMessage`. This allows you to configure how the commit message is generated, if `[skip ci]` gets included, etc.

### Patch Changes

- [#776](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/776) [`ad7506d`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ad7506dc6973293a6f913653c2a6a15ba5b8b500) Thanks [@janosh](https://github.com/janosh)! - `changeset init` will now configure `baseBranch: "main"` in the `.changeset/config.json` as the default value.

- [#769](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/769) [`3e8e672`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/3e8e6721d31f80fff28826e0fad2c14216c3d94f) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an infinite loop involving a fixed group of packages and a package within that group that was both ignored and dependent on another package from that group.

- Updated dependencies [[`3e8e672`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/3e8e6721d31f80fff28826e0fad2c14216c3d94f)]:

## 2.21.0

### Minor Changes

- [#690](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/690) [`27a5a82`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/27a5a82188914570d192162f9d045dfd082a3c15) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Added a new `.changeset/config.json` option: `fixed`. It can be used to group packages that should always be released together. If any package from a group is going to be released then all packages from that group will be released together (with the same version).

  This is similar to what people often know from Lerna as this is how their fixed/locked mode works.

### Patch Changes

- [#706](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/706) [`0812858`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/0812858996045e602d22f2b7dd13e8673e3b36b0) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with `"none"` releases causing package versions being bumped during snapshot releases. In addition to when you create `"none"` release types explicitly Changesets might create them implicitly in some situations, for example under some circumstances this issue caused snapshot releases to be created sometimes for ignored packages.

- [#703](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/703) [`15c461d`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/15c461d5de94a274ccc8b33755a133a513339b0a) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with `*` dependency ranges not being replaced in premode. Those have to replaced with exact versions because prereleases don't satisfy wildcard ranges. A published prerelease package with such dependency range left untouched won't install correct prerelease dependency version.

- [#749](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/749) [`d14cf79`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d14cf79fd323529c6fe6ca956d9a7fda93bb425b) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue that caused **created** CHANGELOG files not being formatted in the same way as the **updated** ones (this could happen when calling `changeset version` for the very first time for a package).

- [#751](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/751) [`59c7ebc`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/59c7ebc7a5e75f69f5487e95a85cd1b7062ac39d) Thanks [@Rugvip](https://github.com/Rugvip)! - Fixed an issue where dependent packages would sometimes not get bumped properly when exiting prerelease mode.

## 2.19.0

### Minor Changes

- [#701](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/701) [`b9b6453`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/b9b6453b16ada9751e2280b5230ded72161391e9) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Added support for a `--no-git-tag` CLI flag that can be used with `changeset publish` to skip creating git tags for published packages. This is mostly useful when publishing snapshot releases.

### Patch Changes

- [#713](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/713) [`82be80e`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/82be80ecfe9288535071e850ae56f2e7a7006eba) Thanks [@zthxxx](https://github.com/zthxxx)! - Fixed an issue with not being able to reenter exited pre mode.

### Patch Changes

- [#676](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/676) [`d8f0e68`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d8f0e6851bddf307b70b03e23b50e0b9410aafa7) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Improved compatibility with npm 7+ since they've started to print errors to the `stderr` (where previously they were printed to `stdout`) when using `npm publish --json`.

- [#676](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/676) [`d8f0e68`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d8f0e6851bddf307b70b03e23b50e0b9410aafa7) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an internal issue that prevented `npm publish --json`'s output to be handled properly. This makes sure that unrelated JSONs printed by lifecycle scripts don't interfere with our logic.

- [#667](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/667) [`fe8db75`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/fe8db7500f81caea9064f8bec02bcb77e0fd8fce) Thanks [@fz6m](https://github.com/fz6m)! - Upgraded `@manypkg/get-packages` dependency to fix getting correct packages in pnpm workspaces with exclude rules.

### Minor Changes

- [#634](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/634) [`2b49c39`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/2b49c390a7cf24ce859ac932b432eb6d8f55c98b) Thanks [@joeldenning](https://github.com/joeldenning)! - The new `changeset tag` command has been added. It can be used to create git tags for all packages.

  This is helpful in situations where a different tool is used to publish packages instead of Changesets. For situations where `changeset publish` is executed, running `changeset tag` is not needed.

  Note that it is expected that `changeset version` is run before `changeset tag`, so that the `package.json` versions are updated before the git tags are created. This command also doesn't take any configuration into account - it simply create tags for all packages with whatever version that is currently in their respective `package.json`.

### Patch Changes

- [#585](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/585) [`74dda8c`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/74dda8c0d8bd1741ca7b19f0ccb37b2330dc9549) Thanks [@javier-garcia-meteologica](https://github.com/javier-garcia-meteologica)! - Add support for `workspace:^` and `workspace:~` dependency ranges.

- [#660](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/660) [`5413f3e`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/5413f3e772bf867234922b0691e3c58c1864412d) Thanks [@tmkx](https://github.com/tmkx)! - Fixed an issue with adding `[undefined]` to the generated changelog when the commit adding a changeset file could not be found. This could have happened when running `changeset add && changeset version` in a single command and when using the default changelog generator.

- Updated dependencies [[`2b49c39`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/2b49c390a7cf24ce859ac932b432eb6d8f55c98b), [`74dda8c`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/74dda8c0d8bd1741ca7b19f0ccb37b2330dc9549)]:

This allows you to prepare a changeset for something that isn't supposed to be released immediately. An example use case could involve code hidden behind a feature flag.

It can be used to add dependent packages to the release (if they are not already a part of it) with patch bumps. To use it you can add this to your config:

  ```json
  {
    "___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH": {
      "updateInternalDependents": "always"
    }
  }
  ```

  This option accepts two values - `"always"` and `"out-of-range"` (the latter matches the current default behavior).

- [`9d99bd1`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/9d99bd16f2b6b3ab4fe820358d4c9f313cb2ae76) [#446](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/446) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with dependent packages not being updated to their highest bump type in pre mode sometimes. This could happen when dependent packages were only versioned because of their dependencies being upgraded and not because of a dedicated changeset for those dependent packages.

  For the very same reason linked packages were also not always bumped correctly in pre mode to the highest bump type in a linked group.

- [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04) [#371](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/371) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added support for ignoring packages in the `version` command. The version of ignored packages will not be bumped, but their dependencies will still be bumped normally. This is useful when you have private packages, e.g. packages under development. It allows you to make releases for the public packages without changing the version of your private packages. To use the feature, you can define the `ignore` array in the config file with the name of the packages:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "ignore": ["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]
    ...
  }
  ```

  or you can pass the package names to the `--ignore` flag when using cli:

  ```
  yarn changeset version --ignore pkg-a --ignore --pkg-b

### Minor Changes

- [`6d0790a`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a) [#359](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/359) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Add support for snapshot flag to version command. Usage: `changeset version --snapshot [tag]`. The updated version of the packages looks like `0.0.0[-tag]-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, and SS is the date and time of when the snapshot version is created. You can use this feature with the tag option in the publish command to publish packages under experimental tags from feature branches. To publish a snapshot version of a package under an experimental tag you can do:

  ```
  # Version packages to snapshot version
  changeset version --snapshot
  # Publish packages under experimental tag, keeping next and latest tag clean
  changeset publish --tag experimental
  ```

Usage: `changeset publish --tag <tag>`. This will publish the packages under passed npm tag.

The package name is being skipped and the scheme matches what `npm version` generates, so for example `v2.8.0`.

### Minor Changes

- [`a679b1d`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/a679b1dcdcb56652d31536e2d6326ba02a9dfe62) [#204](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/204) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Respect `publishConfig.access` in workspace package.jsons

  Previously, every package in your repository had one 'public' or 'restricted' setting.

  Now, if a workspace has `publishConfig.access` in its package.json, we will prioritize it over the global changesets config.

### Patch Changes

  Previously, we had access as "public" or "private", access "private" isn't valid. This was a confusing because there are three states for publishing a package:

  - `private: true` - the package will not be published to npm (worked)
  - `access: public` - the package will be publicly published to npm (even if it uses a scope) (worked)
  - `access: restricted` - the package will be published to npm, but only visible/accessible by those who are part of the scope. This technically worked, but we were passing the wrong bit of information in.

  Now, we pass the correct access options `public` or `restricted`.

## 2.0.0

Welcome to version 2 🎉🦋

Quickest summary of the most exciting changes:

🦋 Changesets (the written files) have a new format! They are now human readable/writeable

🦋 The config options have been completely rethought to be clearer and more concise

🦋 Changesets has been significantly decomposed, allowing an easier time building tools on top of it

### Major Changes

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

#### Changed command line argument names

We have removed command line arguments that overrwrite the config. The following commands can no longer
be passed in:

- `updateChangelog`
- `isPublic`
- `skipCI`
- `commit`

This has been done to avoid overloading the number of ways you can pass options, as within any single
repository, there should be a single consistent way in which these values are always provided.

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

#### Changed how Config works

The Changesets config is now written in JSON with fewer options. The new defaults are shown below.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config/schema.json",
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "linked": [],
  "access": "private"
}
```

**Reasoning**: Having a JSON config makes it easier to build other tools on changesets because the config can be read without executing user code that could potentially be unsafe. It also means we can have easy autocompletion and descriptions in editors that don't go out of date like the comments in the JS config along with being able to packagise changelog entry generators.

##### Migrating

1. Run `yarn changeset init` to create a config file in the new format at `.changeset/config.json`
1. If you're using changelogs, move `getReleaseLine` and `getDependencyReleaseLine` to their own module and set the changelog option to the path to the module. If you're not using changelogs, set the changelog option to `false`. In the future, we will be providing packages to write changelogs for common use cases
1. Set `access` to `"public"` if `publishOptions.public` is `true`, otherwise set it to `"private"`
1. If you use `linked`, copy your linked package groups from the JS config to the the JSON file
1. If you use `commit` and `skipCI` in `versionOptions` or `publishOptions`, set commit to `true`, all commits will include a skip ci message. if you have a use case for only using commit on one command or not including a skip ci message by default, contact us and we will talk about re-implementing these features.
1. Delete `.changeset/config.js`

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

#### Changelog generation functions have minor changes

In addition to how these functions are defined (see changes to config), the data that is passed through
to these functions is notably different to what it was before. For the most part, the changelog functions
simply receive richer information, based on the new changelog format.

**BREAKING**: The release objects and dependency release objects now use `release.newVersion` for the latest
version, instead of the previous `release.version`.

The `@changesets/types` package includes exports for both `GetReleaseLine` as well as `GetDependencyReleaseLine`.

If you were using the default changelog generation scripts, you won't need to worry. Otherwise, we recommend updating
your command and manually running `version` to ensure you are still getting the changelogs you expect.

**Looking further forward** We are already aware that we want to change how people write these generation functions,
including opening up more flexibility, and access to things such as the underlying release plan. This will likely require
a breaking change in the future, but we thought we were changing enough this release that we didn't want too much turmoil. 😁

- [ca8ff585](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ca8ff585) [#147](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/147) Thanks [@Noviny](https://github.com/Noviny)!

#### Renamed commands

- `bump` has been renamed to `version`
- `release` has been renamed to `publish`

This is a reversion to the changes made in `1.0.0`.

**Reasoning**: We switched the names because we wanted to avoid confusion with the related
tasks in npm. While technically it removed confusion that this was doing the same thing as
`npm version`, or `npm publish`, the new terms did not convey easily grokkable meanings. As
we weren't benefiting from the new names, we have decided to revert to names that have more
meaning within the community, even though these commands do slightly more than this.

### Minor Changes

- [296a6731](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/296a6731) - Safety bump: Towards the end of preparing changesets v2, there was a lot of chaos - this bump is to ensure every package on npm matches what is found in the repository.

### Minor Changes

- [16fde2e0](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/16fde2e0) [#75](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/75) Thanks [@mitchellhamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton)! - Use [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) instead of inquirer for asking questions because it's smaller, faster and prettier.
  Change bump type questions from asking for each bump type individually per package to asking users to two questions where the user selects what packages should have major and minor bumps and the packages left are assumed to be patch bumps. This dramatically cuts down the amount of time it takes to create a changeset with a large number of packages.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 9435d886: Fix binary and published files

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 51c8b0d6: Remove `noChangelog` flag in favor of `updateChangelog` flag (default behaviour remains the same).

  If you were using this custom flag, you will need to replaces `noChangelog: true` with `updateChangelog: false`

- 51c8b0d6: Rename commands from @atlaskit/build-releases

  We are no longer mirroring the names from npm/yarn commands, so it is easy to write package scripts
  for each command without footguns. The functionality of the commands remains the same. In addition,
  the binary has been changed to `changeset`.

  The new names are:

  - `build-releases initialize` => `changeset init` (for ecosystem consistency)
  - `build-releases changeset` => `changeset` (default command). You can also run `changeset add`
  - `build-releases version` => `changeset bump`
  - `build-releases publish` => `changeset release`

  The function of these commands remains unchanged.

  - 51c8b0d6: Change format of changelog entries

  Previously changelog entries were in the form of:

  ```md
  ## 2.1.0

  - [patch] Allows passing --public flag for publishing scoped packages [159c28e](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/159c28e)
  - [minor] Changes changelogs to be opt out rather than opt in [f461788](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f461788)
  ```

  which doesn't take into account the importance of particular entries. We are moving to an ordered system for changelog
  entries, and to match this, we are updating the headings we use to the following format:

  ```md
  ## 2.1.0

  ### Minor

  - Allows passing --public flag for publishing scoped packages [159c28e](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/159c28e)

  ### Patch

  - [minor] Changes changelogs to be opt out rather than opt in [f461788](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f461788)
  ```

  This changes the format of the default `getReleaseLine` from

  ```js
  const getReleaseLine = async (changeset, versionType) => {
    const indentedSummary = changeset.summary
      .split("\n")
      .map((l) => `  ${l}`.trimRight())
      .join("\n");

    return `- [${versionType}] ${changeset.commit}:\n\n${indentedSummary}`;
  };
  ```

  to

  ```js
  const getReleaseLine = async (changeset, type) => {
    const [firstLine, ...futureLines] = changeset.summary
      .split("\n")
      .map((l) => l.trimRight());

    return `- ${changeset.commit}: ${firstLine}\n${futureLines
      .map((l) => `  ${l}`)
      .join("\n")}`;
  };
  ```

  You will end up with some odd changelog entries if you do not update your release line.

### Minor Changes

- 51c8b0d6: Support non-bolt repositories

  Changesets have been expanded to support:

  - bolt repositories
  - yarn workspaces-based repositories
  - single package repositories.

  Currently **not** supported: bolt repositories with nested workspaces.

  To do this, functions that call out to bolt have been inlined, and obviously marked
  within the file-system. In addition, the `get-workspaces` function has undergone
  significant change, and will be extracted out into its own package soon.

  This is to support other tools wanting this level of interoperability.

  If plans to modularize bolt proceed, we may go back to relying on its functions.

  This should have no impact on use.

  - 51c8b0d6: Add 'select all' and 'select all changed' options, to make mass-bumping easier.
  - eeb4d5c6: Add new command: `status` - see Readme for more information

# @atlaskit/build-releases - legacy changelog

## 3.0.3

- [patch][c87337f](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/c87337f):

  - The version command now removes empty folders before it starts. This should prevent a race condition in CI

## 3.0.2

- [patch][f7b030a](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f7b030a):

  - Fixes potential infinite loop in parseChangesetCommit

## 3.0.1

- [patch][494c1fe](https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/494c1fe):

  - Update git commit message to match previous tooling.

## 3.0.0

- [major][44ec8bf" d](<https://bitbucket.org/changesets/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/44ec8bf>"
  d):

  Changesets now use local file system - this has several effects:

  1. Changesets will no longer automatically create a commit. You will need to add and commit the files yourself.
  2. Changesets are easier to modify. You should ONLY modify the changes.md file (_Not changes.json_).
  3. There will be a new directory which is `.changeset`, which will hold all the changesets.

  Apart from these changes, your process using this should not have changed.

  Changeset now accepts skipCI flag, where previously release commits automatically skipped CI. i.e.

  ```
  yarn build-releases version --skipCI
  ```

  **Breaking**: Changeset and version commands now accept `--commit` flag which makes them commit automatically (previously this was the default behaviour). Otherwise, these commands simply make the file-system changes.

  ```
  yarn build-releases changeset --commit
  ```

  We also introduce the `intitialize` command. See the package [README.md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atlaskit/build-releases) for more details about this.
