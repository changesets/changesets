### Patch Changes

- [#1361](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/1361) [`954a16a`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/954a16aa1d118a0f7fa745ffe0d19b304f685d4c) Thanks [@jakebailey](https://github.com/jakebailey)! - Version 2.25.0 introduced the `privatePackage` configuration option with default `{ version: false, tag: false }`; due to a bug, these options were not respected in all commands, leading to commands like `changeset tag` still tagging private packages. This has been fixed, and all packages now respect this option.

### Patch Changes

- [#949](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/949) [`64585ea`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/64585ea4323c4cf51a23b0635990b568d1f58b2b) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist), [@BPScott](https://github.com/BPScott)! - Fixed the issue that caused transitive dependents of dev dependents to be bumped when a package got bumped and when using `___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH.updateInternalDependents: "always"`. To illustrate this with an example:

  ```
  pkg-a - version: 1.0.0
  pkg-b - devDependencies['pkg-a']: 1.0.0
  pkg-c - dependencies['pkg-b']: 1.0.0
  ```

  With a changeset for `pkg-a` the `pkg-c` could have been sometimes incorrectly released.

- Updated dependencies [[`8c08469`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/8c0846977597ddaf51aaeb35f1f0f9428bf8ba14)]:

This could have caused runtime errors during snapshot releases when only some of the Changesets transitive dependencies were updated without other ones.

## 5.2.0

### Minor Changes

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#690](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/690) [`27a5a82`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/27a5a82188914570d192162f9d045dfd082a3c15) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Added handling of the `fixed` config option. This adds all the packages from the `fixed` group to the assembled release and added releases end up having the same version.

### Patch Changes

- [#706](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/706) [`0812858`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/0812858996045e602d22f2b7dd13e8673e3b36b0) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with `"none"` releases causing package versions being bumped during snapshot releases. In addition to when you create `"none"` release types explicitly Changesets might create them implicitly in some situations, for example under some circumstances this issue caused snapshot releases to be created sometimes for ignored packages.

- [#751](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/751) [`59c7ebc`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/59c7ebc7a5e75f69f5487e95a85cd1b7062ac39d) Thanks [@Rugvip](https://github.com/Rugvip)! - Fixed an issue where dependent packages would sometimes not get bumped properly when exiting prerelease mode.

- [#703](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/703) [`15c461d`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/15c461d5de94a274ccc8b33755a133a513339b0a) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with dependant packages being always bumped when their `*` dependency was bumped.

- Updated dependencies [[`6f9c9d6`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/6f9c9d60c0e02c79d555c48deb01559057f1d252)]:

## 5.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#667](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/667) [`fe8db75`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/fe8db7500f81caea9064f8bec02bcb77e0fd8fce) Thanks [@fz6m](https://github.com/fz6m)! - Upgraded `@manypkg/get-packages` dependency to fix getting correct packages in pnpm workspaces with exclude rules.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`12f9a43`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/12f9a433a6c3ac38f9405fcd77c9108c423d7101) [#507](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/507) Thanks [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan)! - New setting added: bumpVersionsWithWorkspaceProtocolOnly. When it is set to `true`, versions are bumped in `dependencies`, only if those versions are prefixed by the workspace protocol. For instance, `"foo": "workspace:^1.0.0"`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`12f9a43`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/12f9a433a6c3ac38f9405fcd77c9108c423d7101)]:

### Patch Changes

- [`e92cc01`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/e92cc0138bfbc041c77e6c7d054f2aa101cece5a) [#482](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/482) Thanks [@jonathanmorley](https://github.com/jonathanmorley)! - Fixed an issue with bumping a peer dependency using a `"none"` changeset type resulting in the dependent package being major bumped.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`ab98fe3`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/ab98fe33814867ba740fc04733602be80771915c) [#454](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/454) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Returned releases in pre mode will have type of the highest bump type within the current release now, instead of having the highest bump type from among all changesets within this pre mode. So if you release a new prerelease including a major bump and later release the same package with a minor bump the assembled release will be of type minor - the final computed version will, of course, still be the next one for a major bump.

### Patch Changes

- [`d1d987c`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d1d987c42cddff8be5d7f04d3ebb5a262779fa9f) [#455](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/455) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with linked package being assigned a non-none release type when another package from the linked set has been added to current releases and the package had just a none release type.

- [`9d99bd1`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/9d99bd16f2b6b3ab4fe820358d4c9f313cb2ae76) [#446](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/446) Thanks [@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist)! - Fixed an issue with dependent packages not being updated to their highest bump type in pre mode sometimes. This could happen when dependent packages were only versioned because of their dependencies being upgraded and not because of a dedicated changeset for those dependent packages.

  For the very same reason linked packages were also not always bumped correctly in pre mode to the highest bump type in a linked group.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`d531dbd`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/d531dbdc9ac22faccb20356e9ea1313e5095cf9d) [#412](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/412) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Fixed an issue with the same package specified as a different dependency type with different range types not being updated correctly for all of them.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`addd725`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/addd7256d9251d999251a7c16c0a0b068d557b5d) [#383](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/383) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added an experimental flag `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`. When set to `true`, we only bump peer dependents when peerDependencies are leaving range.

### Minor Changes

- [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04) [#371](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/371) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Added support for ignoring packages in the `version` command. The version of ignored packages will not be bumped, but their dependencies will still be bumped normally. This is useful when you have private packages, e.g. packages under development. It allows you to make releases for the public packages without changing the version of your private packages. To use the feature, you can define the `ignore` array in the config file with the name of the packages:

  ```
  {
    ...
    "ignore": ["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]
    ...
  }
  ```

  or you can pass the package names to the `--ignore` flag when using cli:

  ```
  yarn changeset version --ignore pkg-a --ignore --pkg-b
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [`00e768e`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/00e768e4af921a894debb900f944d4c9a4e27997) [#382](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/382) Thanks [@Feiyang1](https://github.com/Feiyang1)! - Fix a bug where packages that shouldn't get released get patch releases when the pre mode is exit

- Updated dependencies [[`addd725`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/addd7256d9251d999251a7c16c0a0b068d557b5d), [`9dcc364`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/9dcc364bf19e48f8f2824ebaf967d9ef41b6fc04)]:

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`6d0790a`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/commit/6d0790a7aa9f00e350e9394f419e4b3c7ee7ca6a) [#359](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/pull/359) Thanks [@ajaymathur](https://github.com/ajaymathur)! - Add support for snapshot flag to version command. Usage: `changeset version --snapshot [tag]`. The updated version of the packages looks like `0.0.0[-tag]-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, and SS is the date and time of when the snapshot version is created. You can use this feature with the tag option in the publish command to publish packages under experimental tags from feature branches. To publish a snapshot version of a package under an experimental tag you can do:

  ```
  # Version packages to snapshot version
  changeset version --snapshot
  # Publish packages under experimental tag, keeping next and latest tag clean
  changeset publish --tag experimental
  ```
