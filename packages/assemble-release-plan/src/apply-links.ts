  WARNING:
  Important note for understanding how this package works:

  We are doing some kind of wacky things with manipulating the objects within the
  releases array, despite the fact that this was passed to us as an argument. We are
  aware that this is generally bad practice, but have decided to to this here as
  we control the entire flow of releases.

  We could solve this by inlining this function, or by returning a deep-cloned then
  modified array, but we decided both of those are worse than this solution.
